SugarCubes
==========

Processing sketch to run the SugarCubes art car. Requires Processing 2.x, will not run on older versions of Processing.  Open the sketch in Processing and find instructions there. No library installations should be required.  If you don't already have Processing installed you can download here:  http://processing.org/   

If you have git installed, simply run: git clone https://github.com/sugarcubes/SugarCubes.git

Alternatively, download the ZIP from GitHub and expand. Note that the folder will be called "SugarCubes-master." You must rename this to just "SugarCubes" for it to open properly.
